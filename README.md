# Overview of Election Audit
This election audit was done to help the Board of Elections get information on the tabulated results of the US congressional precinct in Colorado. We have calculated the number of votes total, the number of votes per candidate, the percentage of votes compared to the population per candidate and who the winner was.

# Election Audit Summary
By using this script that we used to get the above results we can use this for any election in the US or the world. All we would need are the data results from any county or state election and we can use that data the same way as we did here. For example, we could update our variables to apply to state votes instead of county votes. We also could update our winning candidate results to see who the losing candidate was instead. Everything in this data analysis is easy enough to update for any election to get whatever results the commission needs.
